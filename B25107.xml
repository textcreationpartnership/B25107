            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEREAS for the more speedy supply of Money to defray Our present, great, and necessary expences, We have ordered a quantity of Copper and Brass to be coyned in Crown pieces, each piece having on the one side Our Effigies or Figure on Horseback, with this Inscription round, <hi>Jac. II Dei Gra. Mag. Bri. Fra. &amp; Hib. Rex.</hi> And on the other side the Arms of <hi>England, Scotland, France</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with a Crown in the middle, and this Inscription round, <hi>Christo victore triumpho</hi> 1690. Our Will and Pleasure is, and We do hereby, with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Our Privy Council, order and declare, that the said Pieces of Copper and Brass so coyned, or to be coyned by Our said Order, mark'd and stamp'd as aforesaid, shall, during Our pleasure, pass as current and lawful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney amongst all Our Subjects within this Our Realm of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and likewise in all payments to be made to Vs, or from Vs, or to or from any of Our Subjects within this Kingdom, according to the rates following, that is to say, each of the said pieces to pass for five shillings in all payments whatsoever, hereby strictly charging and commanding all Our Subjects within this Kingdom, to take and receive the said pieces at the rate afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said in all payments to be made to them, and forbidding all persons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever to counterfeit the same, upon pain of being proceeded against as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons guilty of High Treason. And We do by this Our Royal Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion promise and engage, that whensoever the said Money shall be decried, or called in, We shall thereupon receive from all persons such proportion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as shall then remain in their hands, and at the same time either allow them the value thereof according to the rates aforesaid out of what Rents, Duties, or other Debts they shall respectively owe unto Vs, or make them full satisfaction for the same according to the said rates in the coyn then cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in this Our Kingdom.</p>
